To decode a message hidden as text, paste the hidden message into the box below. While blank lines and punctuation of all kinds are ignored, as is the case of letters, there must be no extraneous words in the text. Press the Seek button to decode the message into JavaScrypt-compatible cipher text in the box above. The cipher text will use the encoding specified by the Encoding buttons. If Base64 encoding is requested and the Sentinel box is unchecked, the usual JavaScrypt cipher text start and end sentinels will be omitted; this option permits creating Base64-encoded documents suitable for use with other programs.
