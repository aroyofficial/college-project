To convert an encrypted message to English text, paste the cipher text generated by JavaScrypt into the box below, then press the Hide button. You can control the approximate length of lines of text by setting the Line length, and suppress the interspersing of punctuation and paragraph breaks by unchecking Punctuation. The cipher text may be in any of the encodings supported by JavaScrypt. If the cipher text lacks the sentinels normally included by JavaScrypt (for example, if you're using this page to convert a Base64 file generated by another program to text), you must specify the encoding by checking the corresponding button in the Encoding section below the Hidden Text box.
