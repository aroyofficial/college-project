# Abstract

<p align="justify">
Digital images are being exchanged over various types of networks. With the huge growth of computer networks and the latest advances in digital technologies, a huge amount of digital data is being exchanged over various types of networks. It is often true that a large part of this information is confidential, private or both, which increase the demand for stronger encryption techniques. Steganography is a preferred technique for protecting the transmitted data. It is used to hide information to perform encryption. Steganography techniques are getting significantly more sophisticated and have been widely used. These techniques are the perfect supplement for encryption that allows a user to hide large amounts of information within an image. It seeks to provide a covert communication channel between two parties. The objective of this project is to provide a secret and secured communication between people. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the Internet. This project simply hides a text message in an image file. For hiding secret information in images, there exist a large variety of steganographic techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different
applications have different requirements of the steganography technique used. For example, some applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others require a larger secret message to be hidden. This project intends to give an overview of cryptography, image steganography, their uses and techniques. In this proposed system Cryptography and Steganography are merged together. The contents of secret message are first kept secret by cryptography; whereas in image steganography the encrypted messages as payload are embedded into the cover image using a novel 3-3-2 LSB. The image steganography takes the advantage of human eye limitation. It uses colour image as cover media for embedding secret message. The important quality of a steganographic system is to be less distortive while increasing the size of the secret message. In this project a method is proposed to embed a colour secret image into a colour cover image. A 3-3-2 LSB insertion method has been used for image steganography.

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
Steganography is defined as the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one else, apart from the intended recipient knows the existence of the message. The word “steganography” is basically of Greek origin which means “hidden writing”. The word is classified into two parts: “steganos” which means “secret” and “graphic” which means “writing”. However, in hiding information, the meaning of steganography is hiding text or secret messages into another media file such as image,
text, sound, or video. The word “steganography” is often considered similar to “cryptography” and “watermarking”. Whilst watermarking ensures message integrity and cryptography scrambles the message, steganography hides it. The primary objective of steganography is to avoid drawing attention to the transmission of hidden information. If suspicion is raised, then this objective has been planned to achieve the security of the secret message because if the hackers noted any change in the sent message, then this observer will try to know the hidden information inside the message.<br> 
The basic terminologies used in the steganography systems are the cover message, secret message, secret key, and embedding algorithm. The particular medium such as text, image, audio, video within which the message is to be hidden is known as cover medium.<br>
To provide an extra layer of security, the original message is also changed into some secret message and then it is hidden inside the cover medium. Finally, with the help of embedding algorithm secret message is hidden inside the cover medium. In steganography, before the hiding process, the sender must select an appropriate message carrier, an effective message to be hidden. A robust steganographic algorithm must be selected that should be able to embed the message more effectively. The sender then may send the hidden message to the receiver by using any of modern communication techniques. The receiver can extract the hidden message using the retrieval algorithm. This project proposes an algorithm to hide data inside an image using a secure steganographic technique.<br>
This project comprehends the following objectives –<br>
<pre>
1. Original message is converted into a secret message using a strong symmetric key cryptography algorithm.
2. Secret message is hidden inside the color cover image using 3-3-2 LSB insertion technique.
3. To produce security tool based on steganographic techniques.
